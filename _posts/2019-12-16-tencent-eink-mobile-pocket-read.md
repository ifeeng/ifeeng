I love e-Ink.

So far I haven’t found any electronic reading experience that can compete with it. My iPhone and iPad Pro are certainly convenient and functional as a mini-computer on the move. But reading books or long articles on them is just not something I can bear.

Kindle is good. I have used two of them. The most recent one is Kindle Paperwhite 4 and I still using it regularly. I also have a [Boox Note][Boox] which is sizable enough to offer a comfort in reading. I will write about this devices at some point. Both Kindle and Boox offer me different kind of reading experience depends on the occasions.

Last week I came across a new eInk device from a random jd.com browsing. By the way, by now JD probably figured out I’m a fan of eInk! The device is from Tencent with a catchy name Pocket Read (口袋阅). On a nutshell, it is a mobile size eInk reader, but also a phone that can make calls and do text message. For a price of 800 RMB (roughly $ 114), it is an affordable gadget.

## What I like about it.

It is light and really pocket-size. Although the size of Kindle is arguably good enough for most readers, this one can still easily fit into my suit pocket when I travel. A longer battery life is also an embedded feature for eInk device.

As it is Tencent built, the default reading app is Tencent’s library and bookshop, which you can easily purchase online and pay using wechat wallet’s barcode. Tencent has been actively expanding its bookshop and collection is good enough for Chinese readers. English books are still limited.

In terms of design, a nice little touch is that “one-button” switch between reader and a phone. Once it turns into a phone, you can’t do much other than phone call and text message. Not wechat or other mobile apps. I’m not a big fan of multi-tasking on an eInk device. The technology is designed for reading after all. I haven’t tested the phone call quality yet, but I don’t foresee there is a need for that. Phone-ability in device like this really just for emergency or short call. As for text messaging, the experience is pretty much like in Kindle.

Another above-my-expectation feature is its voice reader. The text-reading voice doesn’t sound robotic.

### A niche usage for students

I showed it to a colleague of mine who is also a gadget enthusiast. After playing around for a few minutes, she found this is a perfect fit for her two sons. For a mum, the device seems to be ideal for reading ebooks, not doing much damage to her teenager’s eyesight, can make phone call for emergency purpose. And...the built-in bookshop also have a parental control on the suitability of reading materials.

That’s quite a niche usage of this pocket read.

## What is lacking?

1. The support for English fonts. It is very limited but it is understandable as it’s a Chinese product for now.

2. Support for wechat post reading. Wechat posts are common in China’s mobile-sphere. Kindle has a wechat app that allow one-click to send a wechat article to kindle wirelessly. It would make sense for this pocket read to deliver this feature. After all it is a Tencent product.

3. Transfer of file between PC and mobile. Current it support its own cloud transfer, which I haven’t tried it yet. But an easier way to transfer eBook from a computer to this device will be desirable.

4. The SIM dock can only support either a SIM card or a SD card. User cannot insert both. If I use SD card to transfer files, the SIM needs to be taken out during the operation. Workable but troublesome.

## Pocket Read II

I bought this three days ago. And just today, 16the Dec, the V2 launched! After reading some review articles in Chinese, I don’t think the incremental 300 yuan will attract me to switch. I can easily send this back to JD as it is within their 7-days return policy, I don’t think I will spend 1K RMB (~ $ 142) on its V2. It seems they have added some more social media elements into the V2 but, again, I appreciate the “reading” element of this gadget.

## Conclusion

For the price, it’s recommendable. After owning several e-ink reading products, I come to understand that developing a good one is not easy. Its size and weight are the key selling points for me. For a business traveler, being able to pick up those fragmented reading moments with a comfortable e-ink screen is a pleasant experience. The ownership of this device is worthy.
