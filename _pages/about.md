Welcome to iFeng Blog. I write about tech and digital things that has an impact in my life. I'm a FinTech guy by day, and a tech / gadget junkie by leisure. My footprint has covered China / Japan and the UK for a large of my life. Currently live in Shanghai and it is a place to be when we talk about the impact of tech to a large part of human race.
